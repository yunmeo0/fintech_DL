# Short-Term Precipitation Forecasting Using Transformers

This project implements a short-term rainfall prediction model using transformer-based attention. It predicts precipitation in Seoul and surrounding regions using minimal data without geographic location inputs.

## Key Features
- Transformer-based model capturing temporal and spatial dependencies
- Minimal data usage, no positional encoding required
- Lightweight with a small parameter space

## Data Overview
- Five regions: Seoul, Goyang, Incheon, Suwon, and Anyang
- Preprocessed to handle missing data and zero/near-zero adjustments

## Future Directions
- Integrate external weather datasets for comparison
- Expand the model for long-term prediction and extreme weather events
